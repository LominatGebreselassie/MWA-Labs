1.Expalin why do we want sometimes to use setImmedate instead of using setTimeout?

    - Generally the usage of setTimeOut and setImmidate depends on your scenario 
    you have in you code. BUT we can use setImmmidate for not blocking the 
    event loop where as setTimeOut can be used for controlled delays.
