2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
     - process.nextTick() is not part of the event loop and it adds the callback 
   into the nextTick queue. Node processes all the callbacks in the nextTick queue
   after the current operation completes and before the event loop continues.
     - SetImmidate schedules a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after 
    events' callbacks..

   => Use setImmediate if you want to queue the function behind whatever I/O
   event callbacks that are already in the event queue. 
   => Use process.nextTick to effectively queue the function at the head of
   the event queue so that it executes immediately after the current 
   function completes.
